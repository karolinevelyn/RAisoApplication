This project for the Lab User Experience course (COMP8129001) focuses on creating a mobile application using Android Studio, with the prototype designed in Axure. The application is developed for RAiso, a renowned online store specializing in stationery products. As RAiso’s transaction data management has become increasingly complex, the app aims to streamline and manage the store’s database transactions more efficiently, ensuring smooth operations and an enhanced user experience.
